    | PROJECT TITLE: Round-Robin Priority Queue Process Coordinator          | 
    |                                                                        |
    | PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Simulate round-robine based priority queue process |
    |                     coordinator using a text file containing mock      |
    |                     processes.                                         |

    | INSTRUCTIONS: 1) Compile both Java Files                               |
    |                     (javac Coordinator.java Process.java)              |

    |               2) Run Coordinator with timeslice & process file as args |
    |                     (java Coordinator 5 "Process Input.txt")           |
    |                                                                        |
    | NOTE: Process Files are split into 3 columns, separated by space.      |
    |       Column 1 represents the process ID.                              |
    |       Column 2 represents the process priority.                        |
    |       Column 3 represents the CPU Bound.                               |
